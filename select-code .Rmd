 **Background:**

This analysis concerns data from a subset of the 2008 American National
Election Study. There are 840 respondents in the sample with varying
characteristics, such as geographical location, aptitude towards
religious services, marital status, ethnic background, and gender. The
goal of this analysis is to determine if these varying categorical
factors influence political ideology. Additionally, the sample of 840
respondents will be analyzed to determine what proportion are moderate,
conservative, and liberal. 

Vernacular: liberal and democratic are used interchangeably;
conservative and republican are used interchangeably. 

\

**Methods:**

*Chi-Square Test of Goodness of Fit--To Test the Proportion of Moderate,
Conservative, and Liberal Respondents:*

A researcher believes that the true proportions of the respondents are
60% moderate, 20% conservative, and 20% liberal. To test whether the
researcher's alleged proportions are true, we will compare the actual
frequencies observed via the sample of 940 respondents the to the
expected frequencies. We will utilize the Chi-Square Goodness of Fit
Test for Specified Proportions. Code can be found in Appendix A: 

Hypotheses: 

H0: π-hat= π0 

Ha: π-hat≠ π0 

These hypotheses mean that we are testing to see if the estimated π (the
estimated population proportion) equals the population proportion quoted
by the researcher. 

Condition: for every cell, the expected cell count 𝐸_𝑖≥5 

Interpretation: If the p-value for this test is less than alpha=0.05,
then we reject the hull hypothesis that the two proportions are equal,
meaning that the proportions are unequal. 

*Test for Independence-- To Test the Accuracy of the Following
Hypotheses:*

1\. Men are more likely than women to identify with the Republican
Party. 

2\. Southerners and Midwesterners are more likely than others to
identify with the Republican Party; northeasterners and westerners are
more likely than others to identify with the Democratic Party. 

3\. Married respondents are more likely than others to identify with the
Republican Party. 

\

The more regularly people attend religious services, the more likely
they are to identify with the Republican Party. 

5\. White people are less likely than others to identify with the
Democratic Party 

To test the accuracy of the hypotheses above, we will conduct a test for
independence and construct a series of contingency tables for each
categorical factor to compare the observed frequency with the expected
frequency. Based on this analysis and the interpretation of the p-value
for that specified Chi-Squared Test, we can determine if the political
ideology is dependent or independent of the categorical factor in
question. 

Interpretation: If the p-value for the specific test for independence is
less than alpha = 0.05, then we reject the null hypothesis: 𝐻0:𝑝𝐹=𝑝𝑀
𝐻𝑎:𝑝𝐹≠𝑝𝑀 where 𝑝𝐹 and 𝑝𝐹 are the proportion of "categorical factor" who
prefer the Democrat party.
