European stock levels for both January and February 2020 were the highest ever recorded for those months. Europe’s high levels of natural gas in storage are the result of a mild winter, which limited winter heating demand, and growing natural gas imports by pipeline and as liquefied natural gas (LNG). \nNatural Gas heating is most common in the regions of northern Europe, which typically results in a majority of the demand for natural gas across Europe. However, this northern region of Europe experienced a very mild winter, so there was a smaller need for heating. As a result, natural gas withdrawals from storage were lower than average, resulting in record-high January and February inventory levels. Europe’s natural gas storage capacity utilization for the first day of March has typically been 38%, based on the previous five years; in 2020, natural gas stocks in Europe started March at 60% of capacity. \nThe other contributing factor to the above average natural gas reserves comes from the increased gas imports from the United States and other parts of Europe and Russia. The United States provided Europe with a record amount of Natural Gas; the United States has been the largest LNG supplier to Europe since November 2019, and in February 2020, LNG imports from the United States reached a new record high at 5.1 Bcf/d—nearly double the volume of Europe’s second-largest supplier, Qatar. Additionally, European pipeline import capacity has increased in recent years, including the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline from Azerbaijan. \nLastly, natural gas prices as measured by the United Kingdom benchmark National Balancing Point (NBP) and the Title Transfer Facility (TTF) were below the average price of the trailing five years. This lower average cost contributed to European countries buying and storing more natural gas. \nEconomic Analysis\nEach of the three contributing factors listed in the summary section (mild winter, increased imports, and declining prices) can be analyzed more thoroughly through the perspective of economics. First we will introduce a simple model that will be the framework for the quantity of natural gas in reserve, illustrating how different global components influence the reserve quantity.\n𝑄𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒=a∗−𝑃𝑛𝑔+𝐼𝑛𝑒𝑡 𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑛𝑔−𝐷𝑛𝑔 \nwhere 𝑄𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒 is the quantity in reserve, a is a coefficient representing the amount natural gas bought at a given Price, 𝑃𝑛𝑔 is the price of natural gas, 𝐼𝑛𝑒𝑡 𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑛𝑔 references the amount of natural gas imported to Europe, and 𝐷𝑛𝑔 represents the overall change in the demand for natural gas. In the simplest form of the model, the quantity in reserve is influenced by the amount of gas bought by the country and set aside as reserve, this is influenced by the price of natural gas. As the price goes down, more gas is bought to set aside as reserve. Continuing on into the full model, the amount of gas that Europe imports positively influences the 𝑄𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒. Furthermore, as the demand for natural gas in a given time period goes down, this inversely influences 𝑄𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒 as less gas is consumed and more gas is set aside. \nIn short, the model above represents what happened in Europe during the winter of 2019 into 2020. As prices fell, 𝑄𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒 increased. As imports increased, 𝑄𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒 increased. Finally, as demand decreased since there was a milder winter, 𝑄𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒 increased. Following the discussion of this model, we will represent these changes graphically. \nFirst let us look at the demand for natural gas curve; reference Appendix A. E is historical equilibrium, and E’ is the new equilibrium given the conditions of a milder winter. As illustrated, the milder than normal winter shifts the 𝐷𝑛𝑔 curve to the left because demand decreases as people do not have to heat their homes as much. The equilibrium quantity moves leftward from Q to Q’. Because the country cannot just shut off the pipe, this difference Q’-Q becomes the reserves since it is not used. \nSecondly, let us consider the supply of natural gas; reference Appendix B. As discussed by the EIA, both Russia and the United States supplied a record amount of natural gas to Europe. Additionally, the pipeline was finished, which supplied Europe with even more natural gas. Both of these scenarios are reflected by a rightward shift of the supply curve, as the quantity of gas supplied to Europe unanimously increases. \nFinally, putting these two shifts in the supply curve together results in the chart demonstrated in Appendix C. As illustrated, the 𝑃𝑛𝑔 decreases, which means European countries can purchase and save more natural gas for a much lower price.\nTrends in Inequality\nGlobal Trends in Inequality\nEconomists have long been fascinated by the pursuit of discovering and quantifying the general laws of capitalism, and in the Twenty- First Century, their efforts have primarily turned towards applying those laws to identify the leading causes of economic inequality. Using decades of historical data and macroeconomic trends, economists analyze the long- run trends in the distribution of income and wealth, the rates of return on capital versus the growth rate of the economy, and the impact of changes in technology and taxation in order to provide a more comprehensive understanding of economic inequality. \nGiven the available data, background and upbringing, and place in history, economists often bring differing yet insightful contributions to the discussion of inequality, which culminate to better comprehension of the subject matter. This essay will review and analyze the work of leading economists in order to summarize the long-run trends in income and wealth inequality described in Roine and Waldenstrom (2015), discuss the leading causes of inequality according to Thomas Piketty (2015), and examine Acemoglu and Robinson’s (2015) critique of Piketty’s work, including the possible shortcomings of Piketty’s argument. \nPart One: Long Run Trends in the Distribution of Income and Wealth\nIn Long Run Trends in the Distribution of Income and Wealth, authors Jesper Roine and Daniel Waldenstrom outline the broad facts about long- run trends in the distribution of income and wealth using historical tax and estate data. Roine and Waldenstrom distinguish three possible broad eras that can usefully describe the overall developments of economic inequality across the 26 countries studied in their section on long- run trends. The first is the period before the First \nWorld War, the second is the period from around 1914 until 1980, and the third consists of the time thereafter. “In the first period evidence is relatively clear on the fact that inequality was historically high in the beginning of the twentieth century” (Roine and Waldenstrom). The general consensus points to the fact that there were relatively high and stable levels of inequality before the twentieth century, despite the lack of clear data. \nRoine and Waldenstrom next discuss the period from around 1914 to 1980, which was characterized by substantial drops in top income shares for almost all countries for which there is data. \"The top percentile share falls from around 20% before 1914 to between 5% and 10% around 1980 (Roine and Waldenstrom). However, the income share for the lower parts of the decile decrease much more modesty. Large parts of these decreases may be attributed to shocks such as the World Wars or the Great Depression, but it is worth noting that these drops occurred in countries that did not take part in war, such as Sweden.\nMost of the drop is related to decreasing capital income, which is income generated by an asset over time, rather than from work done using the asset. This explains why war, for example, decreases the top income shares much more dramatically than the income share for the lower parts of the decile; those at the top of the decile have much more capital income as their assets do work for them over time- such as in the stock market, compared to work done using the asset- which generates less income given the same amount of time. This is why, as we will see, that Thomas Piketty (2015) argues that war and depression are the only levelers of economic inequality. \nThe development after 1980 is less homogenous. In some countries, especially the United States and the United Kingdom, inequality has risen sharply. The developments over the first half of the twentieth century points to the importance of understanding the joint developments of wealth and income as much of the decrease is related to sharp drops in capital incomes in the top. \nThe cumulative impact of taxation over time also seems important, especially for understanding the lack of recovery of top income shares in the decades after the Second World War. In most countries much of the inequality increase is driven by changes within the top decile, suggesting that an explanation must include a mechanism that gives an increasing income advantage to the very top groups, rather than only accounting for differences between broad groups such as, for example, skilled and unskilled. \nThe Rise and Decline of General Laws of Capitalism\nIn 2014, Daron Acemoglu from MIT and James A. Robinson of Harvard University published a critique of Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty- First Century. Acemoglu and Robinson begin with a review of economists Ricardo and Marx, describing how they both attempted to condense the world around them into general laws of capitalism. Acemoglu and Robinson argue that the quest for general laws of capitalism is misguided because it ignores the key forces shaping how an economy functions: the endogenous evolution of technology and of the institutions and the political equilibrium that influence not only technology but also how markets function and how the gains from various different economic arrangements are distributed. They proceed to compare the shortcomings of Ricardo and Marx to those of Piketty, stating that Piketty also falls for the trap of condensing his findings into general laws. \nAcemoglu and Robinson point to various problems in Piketty’s interpretation of the economic relationships underpinning inequality, but the most important shortcoming is that, though he discusses the role of certain institutions and policies, he allows neither for a systematic role of institutions and political factors in the formation of inequality nor for the endogenous evolution of these institutional factors. This implies that his general laws have little explanatory power. They state that the relationship between the interest rate and the rate of economic growth, is not correlated with inequality- according to their regression analysis. Acemoglu and Robinson use data collected from South African and Sweden to demonstrate that using the top decile may miss the big picture about inequality, and that it is impossible to understand the dynamics of inequality in these societies without systematically bringing in institutions and politics and their endogenous evolution. In conclusion, these quests for general laws ignore both institutions and politics. \nPutting Distribution Back at the Center of Economics\nIn Putting Distribution Back at the Center of Economics: Reflections on Capital in the Twenty First Century (2015), Thomas Piketty provides remarks and clarifications regarding his discussion on economic inequality in his pivotal book Capital in the Twenty- First Century- responding to Acemoglu and Robinson’s critique published in 2014. In his reflection, Piketty discusses the relationship between the rental rate of capital (r) and the growth rate of the economy (g) and how it relates to income and wealth inequality. Piketty first clarifies that a common simplification of the main theme is that because the rate of return on capital r exceeds the growth rate of the economy g, the inequality of wealth is destined to increase indefinitely over time.\nPiketty argues that this facet only holds true given certain political shocks and institutional changes, which can be viewed as largely endogenous to the inequality and development process itself—played a major role in the past and will probably continue to do so in the future. Piketty instead argues that when there is a higher gap between r and g, then given certain political schemes or shocks, then inequality is likely to become larger; a higher gap between r and g allows an economy to sustain a level of wealth inequality that is higher and more persistent over time. \nPiketty also distinguishes between income and wealth inequality, stating that income inequality, in countries like the US, the rise in top income shares is due to the rising inequality of labor income, due to the rising inequality of skills and higher education and the exploding top marginal compensation. Piketty contrasts this with the inequality of wealth, which is the inequality of money saved. This often goes hand in hand with income inequality but differs because larger amounts of capital will generate more money by principle. If two people earn the same amount but one has more saved, the one with more saved will have more capital over time. \nConclusion\nThe long- run distribution can be categorized into three eras, all of which take on differing models of economic growth and changing amounts of inequality. With these models, economists can analyze and weigh the effects of these changes stated, such as war or changes in technology and taxation. Overall these discussions lead to a better understanding of inequality and can better guide policy makers to enact the correct steps to try and curb the rising levels of economic inequality in some countries such as the United States and United Kingdom. \nWorks Cited \nAcemoglu, Daron, and James A.

The bond sale was backed by several high-profile Western banks, including PNB Paribas, JP Morgan Chase, HSBC, Citi, and NCB Capital, suggesting that Western financial entities are willing to work with Saudi Arabia despite the furor over Mr. Khashoggi’s death in October of 2018.\nThe Saudi bond sale extends a borrowing spree that began in 2016 while faced with a fall in oil income. In 2016, the country sold $12.5 billion worth of bonds, culminating in the largest sovereign debt issued to date. This statistic shows the national debt of Saudi Arabia in relation to the gross domestic product (GDP) from 2012 to 2017, with projections up until 2022. In 2017, Saudi Arabia’s national debt amounted to approximately 17.21 percent of the gross domestic product in 2018.\nBreaking Down the Government Bonds\nA government bond is a debt security issued by a government to support government spending. Government bonds are considered risk-free and are traded in highly liquid markets. In occasional circumstances, governments can default on these bonds, which is often called a sovereign debt crisis. When investors and banks buy a country’s debt bond, the country promises the investor to pay back the bond amount with an agreed interest by a specified date; in a sovereign debt crisis, the country fails to pay back any or all of the promised amount. Additionally, government bonds yield a typically low rate of return. Only select bonds offer protection against inflation, which may outpace the bond’s interest rate. \nGovernment bonds assist in funding deficits in the federal budget and control the nation’s money supply. When the government repurchases its own bonds, the money supply increases as sellers receive funds to utilize in the market. Eventually, when funds are deposited into a bank, financial institutions utilize the money multiplier to expand the money supply. Alternatively, the government can also sell bonds that reduce the money supply as buyers are forgoing the ability to hold money now for future economic benefit. The government receives cash for its bonds and may proceed in retiring the cash to restrict the money supply if it chooses. The money supply is the entire stock of currency and other liquid instruments circulating in a country’s economy as of a particular time. The money supply can include cash, coins and balances held in checking and savings accounts. \nSaudi Debt Bonds\nBasis point (BPS) refers to a common unit of measure for interest rates and other percentages in finance. One basis point is equal to 1/100th of 1%, or 0.01%, or 0.0001, and is used to denote the percentage change in a financial instrument. One basis point above the Treasurys means that the interest on the bond is 0.0001 above the interest rate that the Treasury offers on their bonds. Increasing the basis points can make the bond more attractive to investors as a higher interest rate will yield a greater return. Five- year debt, 10- year bonds, and 30- year bonds describe the maturity of the bonds. For example, 100 basis points over the 10- year bonds means that the interest rate in the bond is 1% over the interest rate on the 10- year bonds that the US Treasury offers. \nThe kingdom raised $3 billion of long five-year debt at 110 basis points over Treasurys, $5 billion of long 10-year bonds at 145 basis points over Treasurys and $4.5 billion of 30-year bonds at 180 basis points over Treasurys, according to one of the lead arranging banks. In the 2 ½ years since 2016, Saudi Arabia has sold close to $60 billion in bonds, becoming one of the biggest issuers of debt in the emerging markets. \nA $4 billion 10-year bond was priced at 175 basis points over U.S. Treasury bond benchmarks and a $3.5 billion 31-year bond priced at 230 basis points. While those prices offer relatively generous yields for investors, they are similar to what Saudis have paid in the past on bonds and show that demand hasn’t withered for their debt since Mr. Khashoggi’s death. \nThe huge demand, larger than many market participants had expected, was partly due to ultra-low global interest rates and funds’ frustration with a lack of high-yielding assets around the world. The sale was also a success for the world’s top oil exporter in its efforts to convince investors that it can cope with an era of low crude prices and ultimately reduce its dependence on oil. London-based Capital Economics estimated the U.S. dollar issue would finance around a third of next year’s state budget deficit and almost all of the kingdom’s current account gap, meaning its foreign exchange reserves were unlikely to fall much further in coming years. \nSaudi Arabia recorded a government debt equivalent to 17.20 percent of the country’s Gross Domestic Product in 2017. Government Debt to GDP in Saudi Arabia averaged 36.38 percent from 1999 until 2017, reaching an all-time high of 103.50 percent in 1999 and a record low of 1.60 percent in 2014. These figures are in accordance with the Saudi’s rapid expansion and taking on more debt to fuel the growth. \n\n\n\n",

Cruises offer vacationers quite a lot of advantages: the chance to see and experiences new places and cultures; renowned on-board restaurants and wineries with menus from around the world, and entertainment for travelers of all ages. But at the end of the day, the more people, pool water, and ice cream that cruise companies pile on board, the more energy it takes to move the floating city from destination to destination. Those massive energy costs, both to the cruise lines and the environment, will be sure to make you (sea)sick to your stomach. \nThe word colossal doesn’t even begin to describe the size of the newest cruise ships setting sail, and it’s no doubt that they’re trending larger still. The ships sailing away from Royal Caribbean’s ports effuse four to five times as large as the RMS Titanic by internal volume. The number of crew members on a modern-day cruise ship nearly match the maximum number of passengers the Titanic could hold. Something has to keep the 228,000-ton monstrosity inching forward at the high seas. That something is diesel fuel. And a lot of it. \nFor a frame of reference, the average car sold in the United States as of 2019 gets about 25 miles per gallon (mpg) of gas/diesel consumed. If you find yourself rolling up to a Hollywood black tie event in a Rolls Royce Phantom, you’ll likely be getting 11 mpg. The paparazzi guy who drove his mom’s Honda Accord to the event is getting more like 30 mpg. The Boeing 737 you took from LaGuardia to LAX? 0.15 mpg. But how fuel efficient are cruise ships? \n0.0023 miles per gallon. \nIn a given day of sailing, at a cruising speed of 22.6 knots (26 mph), the Oasis of the Seas (one of the larger cruise ships) will burn 11,361 gallons of fuel each hour. The fuel efficiency, then, is 0.0023 mpg. In other words, for every 12.08 feet traveled, the ship will burn a gallon of diesel fuel. \nCruise ships like to add another calculation into their public relations - the mpg per passenger- which is a way to factor in the amount of people the car, airplane, or ship carries. Cruise ships bode quite poorly though still, averaging 17.5 mpg/passenger. Seventeen and a half mpg certainly sounds better than 0.0023 mpg, though, but airplanes average 91 mpg/ passenger. Not so fast, Carnival. \nCruise ships use a lot of fuel. Their diesel fueled generators power not only the massive propellers, but also the soft serve machines, pool heaters, and ovens. Pretty much anything you lay your eyes on contributes to the 66,000 gallons of fuel used per day. So the next time you’re going to click buy on Royal Caribbean or Carnival’s website, just think that with the amount of fuel used in just one day out of your seven-day trip, you’d be able to drive your car around the entire Earth about 66 times. Just let that sink in. \nLange vs. California\nFour seconds. Four seconds was all the time Arthur Lange had to react to flashing police lights before exiting his car and walk into his garage. Oh, and by the way, it typically takes the human brain 5 seconds to fully process what it’s seeing. Four seconds should not determine whether or not unwarranted search and seizure is lawful. Nor should the government allow an unwarranted search and seizure for any crime committed. \nIn the late evening of an October Friday in 2016, when California Highway Patrol Officer Aaron Weikert observed Arthur Lange playing music loudly and honking repeatedly while driving, Weikert thought Lange might be impaired and gave pursuit. But Weikert did not turn his flashing lights on as he gave pursuit, he followed Lange stealthily. It wasn’t until Lange was four seconds away from his garage door when Weikert remembered how to turn on his police lights. \nThe next thing Lange knows, he’s being arrested- in his garage- and the intent of the Fourth Amendment is confronted in the U.S. Supreme Court. \nThe question in Lange v. California is whether police officers who pursue someone suspected of a misdemeanor into a home may conduct a warrantless search or seizure. It is well-established that police in “hot pursuit” of a suspected felon in public may follow that suspect into a residence. But what about police who are in “hot pursuit” of a misdemeanant? \nIn the United States, misdemeanors account for 80% of American criminal dockets 2, which means that almost eight times out of 10, when a crime is committed, it’s a misdemeanor. Expanding the police’s authority to conduct unwarranted search and seizures for nearly every crime committed would be a massive over-reach by the government. \nPetty theft? The police can follow you into your home. Public intoxication? The police can search your things and personal effects. The “sanctity of the home,” as it were, would be a distant memory of a fleeting pastime. \nWhat’s more alarming about this governmental overreach, however, is its potential to worsen the relationship between minorities and the police, who already bear a disproportionate brunt of law enforcement. In his book David and Goliath, Malcom Gladwell contends that in order for policing to be effective (anywhere), the community must respect and find the police force legitimate. Gladwell continues to argue that when every minority has a brother or father or cousin in prison, it can be difficult to believe the system is fair or legitimate. If the system isn’t fair, how can you believe that those in charge of enforcing that system will be fair and impartial in return3 ? \nNow imagine that if every time a police officer had suspicion that a minority was committing a misdemeanor, that police officer had the right to search and seize that individual’s house without a warrant. The already frayed relationship between the police and minorities would be beyond repair. \nThe prosecution, however, does raise an interesting argument. The United States contends that the risk of a misdemeanant evading arrest can be just as great as for a felony suspect: in both cases, \"the suspect already has chosen to flee once, suggesting his willingness to take on the risks \nof flight again.4\" In fact, the United States contends that a suspect’s attempted escape suggests that he has committed a more serious offense than the one for which he is being pursued; in the moment, an officer may not be aware of the full scope of the crime. The prosecution goes on to argue that not granting the police force the ability to pursue without a warrant would encourage fleeing to house. \nThe prosecution’s argument, however, can be thinned in one of three ways. First, if Lange had actually been posing a serious threat to the community that he needed to escape into his house to prepare for it, then Weikert should have recognized that and turned on his lights sooner instead of at the last possible minute. If Lange was running from a more heinous crime, as purported, then why did Weikert wait so long to attempt to apprehend Lange? \nSecond, the prosecution’s entire argument rests upon the assertion that Lange was fleeing and evading the police officer. But Weikert did not signal to Lange that he was following him until four seconds before Lange entered his garage. Four seconds is not enough time to recognize that the glimpse of flashing lights behind were actually directed at you. \nThird, the ACLU assert that “requiring police to obtain a warrant in hot pursuit situations would not encourage fleeing because police can procure warrants remotely within minutes.” \nThe government’s desire to allow unwarranted search and seizure in the case of misdemeanors would directly infringe upon the right guaranteed under the Fourth Amendment. It would serve as a massive over-reach of the government and police force and could be disproportionally concentrated upon communities that already bear the burden of excessive policing. Furthermore, these costly externalities come without novel benefits. The solutions already exist in the criminal justice system. \n“America’s Massive Misdemeanor System Deepens Inequality and Burdens Low-Income Communities.” Equal Justice Initiative, 29 Apr. 2020, eji.org/news/americas-massive-misdemeanor-system-deepens-inequality/#:~:text=Natapoff%20estimates%20that%20misdemeanors%20comprise,judges%20face%20crushing%20case%20loads. \nDyne, Emily Van, and Matthew Tinker. “Lange v.

For centuries, brave captains and their steadfast crews skillfully navigated this shipping route around the continent of Africa- for it was the only way to transport teas and spices from India to Europe. With the blockage of the Suez Canal by the Ever Given, captains face the same decision their predecessors did all those years ago: stay in the Indian Ocean or circumnavigate Africa. \nThe Ever Given’s blockage of the Suez Canal continues to profusely affect trade between the East and the West. On average, 93 cargo ships make their journey through the Suez Canal each day, which means over 400 ships currently await passage. Analysis from the Wall Street Journal shows the stranded ship is holding up an estimated $9.6bn of trade along the waterway each day. That equates to $400m and 3.3 million tons of cargo an hour, or $6.7m a minute. What options do the containership captains face? Wait in line for the freeing of the Ever Given or seek passage around the Cape of Good Hope. \nCircumnavigating Africa adds about eight days of travel to the journey from Taiwan to the Netherlands, on average. Eight days longer means feeding and paying your crew more, not to mention keeping the propellers turning for another 192 hours. However, once captains’ factor in all the costs, going around Africa makes much more sense than waiting in line for the Ever Given to be freed. \nFor the past year and a half, fuel prices have been trending lower, which means containerships can circumnavigate Africa for a much lower cost than historically possible. Furthermore, not using the Suez Canal means that shipping companies will avoid the $700,000 fee the Suez Canal Authority charges for passage of a fully loaded containership. When the economic impacts ($6.7m a minute) of stalling in the Indian Ocean are taken into account, turning around and heading for Africa is the clear choice. \nSocial Media Password Laws\nAmericans work hard, maybe even a little too hard, and the scale of work-life balance is tilting pretty heavily towards the “work side.” When the closing bell rings and the neon Open sign flickers out, the last thing employees want to think about is work- let alone worry about representing their company 24/7 every day of the year. A bill passed by the New York State legislature would help New York residents relax almost as much as that glass of wine after work. \nPassing New York AB 1844 would prohibit employers from requesting or requiring employees and applicants to disclose their social media log-in information for the purpose of accessing social media accounts. Passing such a law would not be unprecedented- California was the first state to pass such a policy eight years ago, and many other states have followed in their footsteps. The New York State legislature should also pass the bill to protect its citizens from the evident overreaching of the government and companies into the personal lives of employees across the state. \nRequesting or requiring employees and applicants to disclose their social media log-in information (including but not limited to passwords and usernames) adds a substantial load of stress on top of an already full load. Not only would employers be able to seen the front end of each social media platform (e.g. posts, comments, likes) but if passwords were no longer private, the employer would also have access to the account’s archives, private messages, and viewing history. Whether in the office or on the clock, such a policy would require the employee to represent the company at all times. All posts, messages, comments, and likes to become subject to review and potential scrutiny by the employer, adding substantial stress to the already fragile \nwork- life balance. Employers would have access to all front and back end content on all social media platforms, which could include messages with the man/woman who you like; it could include content that you’ve saved; it could include funny yet offensive memes that you’ve sent to your best friend. \nAccording to a study conducted by CNBC news, 26% of surveyed employees in the United States rate their stress level as 4.2/5 and altogether 70% of employees rate their stress as a 3.5/5 or higher. The South Louisiana Health Association, in concurrence with other leading health associations, cite that stress is the primary cause of many health problems, both mentally and physically. Employees do not need the added stress and anxiety that would come if employers had access to who their social media. Many working adults use social media as a way to unwind after work, and it is possible that their usage would decrease with employer intervention. Furthermore, constantly fearing termination or probation based on their online presence in and of itself induces stress and anxiety. \nSocial media also hosts a place for political and religious discourse. Granting employers the ability to see behind the scenes of their employees’ accounts welcomes the risk for discrimination in the workplace. Political and religious affairs are often private matters, and if a perspective employer or current employer discovers such private information, this could affect their attitude and propensity to hire somebody. Discrimination in the workplace laws make it illegal to discriminate based on religious, political, or otherwise private information. Allowing employer access to private information online would enable them to discriminate without anyone knowing about it. Your interviewer may not like that you’re posting LGBTQ events and refuse to hire you. Your boss may see that you attended a Bernie Sanders rally and refuse you your next \nraise. This infringement of privacy further breaks down the work-life balance relationship and requires the submission of your private life for the image of the company. \nIn some select cases, though, it would make sense for the employer to want access to the back end of individual’s social media accounts. Companies want to minimize their liabilities, and when they hire a person, they incur a liability for the actions of that individual, both professionally and privately. In light of the recent riots at the US Capitol, if a company or firm could have foreseen their employee’s involvement in the mob before they hired them via their social media trends, chances are they would not have hired that individual. The same can be said for excessive partying, drug use, or fringe group involvement that often appears on social media. If a firm can lower its liability, it will try to do so. Background checks and drug tests are common in the hiring process, and social media checks may very well be next on that list. \nThat being said, stalking social media accounts is not the best option in the hiring process, or at least it shouldn’t be. In some cases it might be useful in identifying problematic or criminal applicants, but there are better ways to identify those types of people. Maybe the hiring process needs some revamping. If employers cannot grasp the character of a person through an application, resume, cover letter, Hirevue, and multiple rounds of interviews, something must be wrong. Firm’s shouldn’t have to rely on social media to make informed decisions about their current or perspective employees. Though employees should be contentious of how their actions on social media might affect the firm they work for, it is a clear overstep of personal privacy to allow firms constant and unrestricted access to social media accounts. The marginal stress would be too high to justify the arduous and anxiety causing process, and firms most likely won’t be learning any new information anyway. \n\n\n\n",

Roger Stone\nJurors are poised to deliberate Thursday morning after prosecutors conclude their case against political operative and strategist Roger Stone in the government’s latest move in getting to the bottom of the alleged collusion in the 2016 presidential election. \nIn their closing statements on Wednesday, the U.S. Attorney’s Office painted Stone as a “serial liar” to jurors, who “repeatedly lied to members of Congress” during the three hours of questioning about his and the Trump Campaign’s effort to find political dirt on Trump’s 2016 opponent. \n“He lied not once, not twice, not three or four or five times. Stone lied over and over to the House Intelligence Committee,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Johnathan Kravis told jurors Wednesday afternoon. \nStone pleaded not guilty to a seven-count indictment, which charged him with obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and lying to the House Intelligence Committee as it investigated the 2016 election interference by Russia. \n“Stone sat before the House Intelligence Committee in 2017 to answer questions about his involvement in the Trump Campaign’s procurement of stolen WikiLeaks documents,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Morando told jurors. “Stone participated freely but had every intention to lie about the circumstances.” \nThe House committee wanted to know the name of Stone’s contact at WikiLeaks, whether it was an intermediary or WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Previously, Stone had publicly \nannounced at a Trump rally that he had personally spoken to Assange and that “more documents were on the way.” He now denied he ever said that. \nStone’s lies prohibited Congress from understanding how the WikiLeaks document releases unfolded and what it meant for the investigation into Russian collusion. \nIn his Stone’s defense, attorney Bruce Rogow told jurors that Stone had no reason to lie to protect Trump, who was by that time president. Rogow then argued that Stone’s affiliation with WikiLeaks was entirely legal. \n“There was nothing illegal about the campaign being interested in information that WikiLeaks was going to be putting out,” Rogow said. “This is what happens in a campaign. They look for opposition information. It happens every day; it happens in every campaign.” \nKravis refuted Rogow’s argument, stating that “Because of Stone’s lies, the committee never interviewed Stone’s intermediaries or saw his correspondence, and their report is not accurate when it says there is no evidence that he got information from WikiLeaks.” \nStone’s attorneys argued that he did not intend to lie to the House committee “because Stone thought the questions were asked only within the scope of Russian collusion.” \nKravis did not buy Rogow’s argument, calling the line of logic “nonsense.” The U.S. Attorney then showed jurors highlighted lines of Stone’s House testimonial transcript, where he acknowledged the importance of the WikiLeaks document releases. \n“Stone’s defense rests primarily on the premise of government overreach,” Attorney Paul Kamenar said during a court recess. “As long as the defense can prove that Stone’s lying had nothing to do with the Russian collusion, the prosecution has nothing.” \nKamenar was set to represent his client Andrew Miller, Stone’s “wingman,” but the defense never called Miller to the stand. Kamenar now sat in the audience as a spectator \nIn his closing remarks, Morando called the jurors to action to reject Rogow’s argument of complacency. \n“At the end of the day, it’s a question of why it matters that we’re here today,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Morando told jurors. “We’re here today because truth matters. Roger Stone was fully aware that if any of this information got out, it would look really, really bad for his longtime friend and associate Donald Trump.” \nIran\n Iranian Internet Blackouts and Economic Sanctions\nThe internet trickled back to life Sunday morning after the Iranian government successfully cut off all connectivity to the country for more than a week in an attempt to curb protector behavior. \nThe new wave of blackouts highlight the Treasury Department’s inability to combat foreign government-led initiatives that censor and control its citizens, a tactic that is becoming “more prevalent in countries facing political unrest,” Susan Aaronson said, a research professor of International Affairs at the George Washington University (GWU). \n“In early November, the Iranian government began steeply increasing the price of gasoline that led to nationwide unrest and demonstrations, including the burning of gas stations, grocery stores, and banks,” Aaronson said. \nAnalysts from the Atlantic Council say the internet shutdown is an attempt by the Iranian government to stop the flow of information- such as the correct price if gasoline- and to silence the violent demonstrations. \nThe Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) took action against Iran’s Minister of Information and Communications Technology, Mohammad Javad Azari Jahromi, for his role in the Iranian regime’s widescale internet censorship- according to a statement by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. \n“Iran’s leaders know that a free and open internet exposes their illegitimacy, so they seek to censor internet access to quell anti-regime protests,” Mnuchin said. \"We are sanctioning Jahromi \nfor restricting internet access, including the restriction of popular messaging applications that help tens of millions of Iranians stay connected to each other and the outside world.\" \nRemoving all connectivity makes communication with one another impossible, whether it’s on the ground or with friends and family overseas. \nThe blackouts put enormous strain on many Iranians, even outside of the country. \n“I haven’t been able to talk to my family for almost two weeks now, and I have no idea if they have been hurt in any of the demonstrations,” Amir Ali Aminian said in an interview last week. “I was planning on taking a flight home for the Thanksgiving break to see them, but I couldn’t even buy a plane ticket home.” \nAminian, a native Iranian and freshman at the George Washington University, is among countless others who still do not know the fate of their friends and families even though the protests started weeks ago. \nAminian turns to the U.S. government for resolve, but it is uncertain as to what power the government holds. \n“To find resolve, the U.S. government can either work through the Department of State to find an agreeable, diplomatic solution, or look for a solution of fiscal attrition with the Treasury Department,” Aaronson said. “Given the current state of diplomatic talks with Iran, it is clear why the government chose to impose sanctions.” \nWhat is not clear, however, is the effectiveness of further economic sanctions that the Treasury levies on Iranian officials. \nEconomic sanctions have already crippled Iran’s crucial oil exports, and the U.S. has sanctioned Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and other top-ranking officials. Yet instances of internet blackouts are becoming more frequent and are lasting for extended periods. \nDuring protests in 2017, Iranian officials shut off 15% of connectivity throughout the country for a few hours. When protests erupted again in 2018, officials managed to shut off 60% of connectivity within the country. In last week’s protests, 96% of connectivity was shut off, spanning a record eight days. \n“Iran’s capabilities have progressed substantially over the past two years while the counter censorship effort has lagged,” David Grier said, an Associate Professor of International Science and Technology Policy and International Affairs at GWU. “This is very worrisome for the global community.” \nAccording to Doug Madory, the Director of Internet Analysis at Oracle, the latest incident is very unusual in scale and “much more advanced than anything we have yet to see from Iran.” \nIran is not the only country to take such drastic measures. Myanmar, China, India, Zimbabwe, Venezuela, and other nations have also previously blocked the internet and censored the content that their citizens can view. \n“The Treasury needs to find a way to better deter and prevent countries from shutting down their internet and leaving their citizens completely in the dark,” Aaronson said. “It’s a violation of basic human rights.” \nThe United Nations explicitly identified government-led internet shutdowns and censorship as a human rights violation in their June 2016 General Assembly meeting, yet the issue remains largely unsolved. \n“The Office of Foreign Assets Control must figure out a viable way to enforce the U.N.’s resolution, especially as more and more people become entirely dependent on the internet,” Grier said. “It’s in everyone’s best interest.” \nTreasury Department\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Brings Lawsuit Against Treasury Department\nThe House’s Ways and Means Committee sued the Treasury Department in July of 2019 to obtain six years of President Trump’s tax returns in “the Democrats’ latest push to uncover any financial malfeasance.” \n“Finding out whether or not President Trump paid his taxes is a top priority for Democrats and could discredit many of the president’s assertions,” said Steven J. Balla, a Professor of Political Science and Public Policy at the George Washington University. “Suing the Treasury is their newest approach in obtaining Trump’s returns.” \nUnder current tax codes, all tax returns are private information, and government officials face prosecution if they release them. However, under the same law, the Ways and Means Committee chairman can request and review any taxpayer’s returns. \nAccording to Balla, the law creates a slippery slope for lawmakers. If Trump’s returns point to malfeasance, the House committee would find difficulty prosecuting Trump, because in order to do so, “policy makers would have to release the returns as evidence.” \nIt would take a separate committee vote to make any returns public information. \n“Trump broke a 40-year tradition of major-party presidential candidates and presidents when he failed to release his tax returns,” Professor Kirsten E. Martin said, a business law and ethics professor and researcher at the George Washington University. “Since we have never seen this before, lawmakers are going to have to establish a new precedent.” \nChairman Richard Neal (D., Mass.) asked the courts to enforce a previously filed subpoena that Secretary Mnuchin and IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig have repeatedly defied. \nMnuchin and Rettig argued that the request was “unprecedented and outside the scope of congressional authority,” according to a Treasury Department memo. \nThe new lawsuit seeks a court order that would immediately require the officials to produce six years’ worth of Mr. Trump’s tax returns and audit records, ultimately bypassing the failed subpoena solution. \nThe Committee cited Section 6103(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, which requires in mandatory terms that Treasury “shall furnish” the Committee with “any” requested tax return information, according to the code. \n“Since its passage, the Committee has routinely used Section 6103(f) for these purposes, and the Executive Branch has met its duty to comply with those requests,” cited Todd Garvey, an attorney at the Congressional Research Service. “The section, though, has never been used to ensure the sitting president hand over tax returns.” \nThe Committee faces an uphill battle against both time and the Justice Department’s stark position on the matter. \n“When the new congress takes office on Jan. 3, 2021, the entire process of requests and lawsuits would have to start over at that time,” said Professor Vincy Fon, a professor of law and economics at the George Washington University. “Both sides of the aisle very well know this, and I suspect President Trump will take advantage of this and try to run out the clock.” \nThe Justice Department has also backed Treasury Secretary Mnuchin’s refusal to hand over the tax returns. \nIn a 33-page opinion released on June 14, the Office of Legal Counsel for the DOJ wrote that “Mr. Mnuchin accurately and reasonably concluded that he could not satisfy the request from Rep. Neal.” \nThe memo argues that the request was actually designed to make the returns public, not to oversee the performance of the Internal Revenue Service. \n“Allowing a congressional committee to dictate when Treasury must keep tax information confidential and when it must disclose such information would impermissibly intrude on executive power,” the memo said. \nThe Office of Legal Counsel, which is run by Mr. Engel, a Trump appointee, offers advice to the executive branch, but its guidance doesn’t carry the force of law. \nThe matter has since risen to the New York State Court of Appeals, where Trump’s legal team argued that the Ways and Means Committees motif behind suing the Treasury for release of the tax returns was politically inspired in light of the coming election. \nJohn Forrer\n Dr. John Forrer Loves Chocolate, as long as it’s Conflict Free\nThough located only five blocks away from the United States Department of the Treasury, economists and business people like Dr. John Forrer still struggle to stay ahead of changes in economic policy as they fight for a more sustainable world. \nCrammed into a tiny office on the top floor of Duques Hall, John Forrer single-handedly runs the Institute for Corporate Responsibility (ICR), a chartered institute devoted to the research, development, and promotion of corporate sustainability and responsibility. \n“It’s always an uphill battle navigating the ever-changing landscape of domestic and foreign economic policy,” said Dr. Forrer in a discussion on Monday. “Every policy and piece of legislation matters to ensure proper corporate responsibility- staying ahead of the curve is vital.” \nAt the ICR, Dr. Forrer focuses primarily on impact investing, a branch of investment management that helps fund companies, organizations, or communities intending to generate a measurable, beneficial social or environmental impact alongside a financial return. \nOn this particular day, like any other, Dr. Forrer sits back in his office chair with his leg crossed over the other. His four office walls are stacked floor to ceiling with books on trade, foreign policy, and economic sanctions. A map depicts everywhere he’s been; papers of all sorts litter his desk; coffee rings stain the maple. He has a book about chocolate pulled aside. \nPublished over 50 times in articles, books, book chapters, and monographs, Dr. Forrer is a leading academic and researcher at the crossroads where public policy, corporate governance, and impact investing come together. His projects take him all over the world, from Kenya to India. Today’s topic, however, was chocolate. \nIn an initiative that began in January, Dr. Forrer and the ICR worked closely with leading chocolate companies to ensure that the cocoa used to make the chocolate was sourced from ethically grown and ethically governed regions of the world. \nAs Dr. Forrer noted, this was incredibly hard to do. \n“John has one of the toughest jobs of all, and that’s convincing profit-seeking companies to invest in social and environmental change,” said Cynthia Glassman, the former Commissioner of the SEC and colleague of Dr. Forrer. \nDr. Forrer and Hon. Glassman’s relationship dates back many years, to the time before President Bush appointed Hon. Glassman as the Commissioner of the SEC in 2009. Now, she helps Dr. Forrer navigate the landscape of corporate SEC regulations and Treasury policies as they try to enact social change. \n“As the Trump administration tightens the economic grip on many countries around the world, getting the green light to provide aid within these vulnerable areas becomes harder,” said Dr. Forrer. \nDespite these policy changes, Dr. Forrer’s efforts were primarily successful. Dr. Forrer now sits on the Atlantic Council and One Earth Future Council as an expert in public policy and economics. \nThe Conflict-Free Chocolate initiative accompanies many others that occupy Forrer’s desk at a given time. It’s frequently difficult for his colleagues to keep up. \n“Last semester when I worked for him, it usually was pretty hard to walk into his office,” said Charlotte, a fellow research assistant. “He would have to clear a path of papers off the floor just for me to reach the chair where I was supposed to sit.” \nRegardless, Forrer’s style works for him. He has made great strides in Sustainable Supply Chain Systems to create business partnerships that provide Wi-Fi in remote and under-served communities. \n“I hope to make impact investing a better option for more companies and investors,” said Forrer. “Right now, it’s too expensive for the little return investors are getting, but we’re working to turn that around.” \nForrer’s most recent journal articles include: “Business and Peace in the Buffer Condition” (2015), Academy Management Perspectives Vol. 29 no. 4 438-450; and “The PACO Index,” (2016) with Timothy Fort, Business Horizons (Forthcoming). \nCycling in the District\nTicTok challenges, gardening, and baking sourdough bread kept many individuals sane when lockdowns swept across the country in the Spring of 2020. But as the cool months of March turned into summer, Americans needed a safe way to get outside and burn off some of those extra quarantine calories. Cycling quickly became the go to sport, and bikes flew off the racks bike stores across the country.\n“Demand [for bikes] has increased, it’s skyrocketed even…,” John Churan said, a bike fitting specialist at Bicycle Pro Shop in Georgetown. “Folks found that it was a great way of getting yourself out of the apartment, and a great way to get your mind out of the house too.”\nJohn stressed that cycling in particular became popular because an individual at any skill level can pick it up, and all that’s required is a bike (and helmet, of course). Even though John races his bike competitively now, he didn’t learn to ride until he was 13 years old, when most kids learn when they’re four or five.\n“I had a traumatic experience when I first tried learning as a kid.” John said. “I didn’t try again until I was 13, but after that, I rode every day that summer.”\nJohn started racing his bike in college in Pennsylvania and competed against schools up and down the eastern seaboard. His favorite part about colligate racing was seeing one of his teammates in matching jerseys during a race and feeling inspired to ride his best. That same sense of comradery keeps John racing to this today.\nThat D.C. cycling community includes men like David Miller, a retired Air Force paratrooper.\n“I turned to cycling because my knees couldn’t withstand the impact anymore,” David said. “Landing a parachute wearing full tactical armor plus all of your equipment is the equivalent of jumping off the roof of your house. And I did that over one-hundred times.”\nDavid first fell in love with cycling while on a trip to Costa Rica because it better allowed him to explore and experience his surroundings.\n“The feeling of freedom from when I was a kid is the same now,” David said. “If you see something to the right out your car window, you aren’t going to stop. But I can.”\nWhen David races his bike, he prefers a style called cyclocross. Different than traditional road racing, cyclocross is a fast-paced alternative where competitors have to ride and run over obstacles throughout the course. In fact, riders are required to dismount and run at least twice throughout the race’s duration. The courses David races on involve running up two flights of stairs, while carrying your bike.\n“What it’s about is pushing your personal comfort zone, hopefully you spent the year training and you’re confident in your bike handling skills,” David said. “That’s what makes me a better cyclist because I’m used to riding at the limit of my physical ability but I’m also thinking about what the guy next to me is doing…”\nOnce again, as spring turns to summer in the District, popular riding locales like Hains Point will see a spike in cyclists riding its roads. Fortunately for the newcomers, there aren’t any stairs to run up.\n\n\n\n",

I also perform equity analysis through the terminal and then export key information to my Excel based Discounted Cash Flow Analysis spreadsheet. Other Bloomberg skills include competitor analysis (comparing the financials of similar companies), the SWAP manager tool, and finding real time data on fixed income, derivatives, and economics news.\nMicrosoft Suite\nThe Microsoft Suite includes Excel, Word, and PowerPoint.\nI possess many skills in Excel that lend to data cleaning, financial analysis, economic model building, and automation. A few of these skills include Visual Basics(designing and implementing Macros), creating Pivot Tables, What-If Analysis, V-Lookup, If-Then statements and sorting.\nVisual Basics is the coding language of excel and allows one to create macros that create replicable steps for spreadsheet automation. Pivot tables allow you to extract significance from large datasets, including summary statistics for any variable in the data. What-If analysis gives one the ability to create data tables and perform “goal-seek”, a tool used to calculate backward. V-Lookup is a way to reference tables.\nSAS\nSAS is a piece of data analysis software used for data management, advanced analytics, multivariate analysis, business intelligence, criminal investigation, and predictive analytics.2\nMy skill set in SAS includes performing parametric and non-parametric tests, cleaning and sorting data, linear regressions, multiple linear regression, non-linear regression, Econometrics, normality tests, tests for robustness, and tests for variance and covariance.\nParametric tests versus non-parametric tests simply refer to the presence/ absence of assumptions or parameters that add to the statistical significance of a test. Examples include the T-Test, Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, Chi-Square Test for Goodness of Fit, and the Shapiro-Wilk Test. Regressions are a way of determining the relationship between dependent and independent variables. Tests of robustness are a way of determining how sensitive your model or regression is to changing conditions.\nPython\nPython is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language.3\nMy skills in Python include creating financial models, financial analysis, time series analysis, computing dynamic thresholds, bootstrap aggregation for variance reduction and improved model accuracy, and back testing.\nR\nR is a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis.4\nSkills in R include cleaning data, performing basic analysis with small and large datasets, creating basic charts (par, pie, donut), linking R-Studio to Git and Github, and knitting together projects via Distill into a functioning public website.\nOther\nSQL (Basic)\nSTATA\nQuick-Books\nTableau\n\n“Bloomberg Professional Services”.
