European stock levels for both January and February 2020 were the highest ever recorded for those months. Europe’s high levels of natural gas in storage are the result of a mild winter, which limited winter heating demand, and growing natural gas imports by pipeline and as liquefied natural gas (LNG). \nNatural Gas heating is most common in the regions of northern Europe, which typically results in a majority of the demand for natural gas across Europe. However, this northern region of Europe experienced a very mild winter, so there was a smaller need for heating. As a result, natural gas withdrawals from storage were lower than average, resulting in record-high January and February inventory levels. Europe’s natural gas storage capacity utilization for the first day of March has typically been 38%, based on the previous five years; in 2020, natural gas stocks in Europe started March at 60% of capacity. \nThe other contributing factor to the above average natural gas reserves comes from the increased gas imports from the United States and other parts of Europe and Russia. The United States provided Europe with a record amount of Natural Gas; the United States has been the largest LNG supplier to Europe since November 2019, and in February 2020, LNG imports from the United States reached a new record high at 5.1 Bcf/d—nearly double the volume of Europe’s second-largest supplier, Qatar. Additionally, European pipeline import capacity has increased in recent years, including the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline from Azerbaijan. \nLastly, natural gas prices as measured by the United Kingdom benchmark National Balancing Point (NBP) and the Title Transfer Facility (TTF) were below the average price of the trailing five years. This lower average cost contributed to European countries buying and storing more natural gas. \nEconomic Analysis\nEach of the three contributing factors listed in the summary section (mild winter, increased imports, and declining prices) can be analyzed more thoroughly through the perspective of economics. First we will introduce a simple model that will be the framework for the quantity of natural gas in reserve, illustrating how different global components influence the reserve quantity.\n𝑄𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒=a∗−𝑃𝑛𝑔+𝐼𝑛𝑒𝑡 𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑛𝑔−𝐷𝑛𝑔 \nwhere 𝑄𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒 is the quantity in reserve, a is a coefficient representing the amount natural gas bought at a given Price, 𝑃𝑛𝑔 is the price of natural gas, 𝐼𝑛𝑒𝑡 𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑛𝑔 references the amount of natural gas imported to Europe, and 𝐷𝑛𝑔 represents the overall change in the demand for natural gas. In the simplest form of the model, the quantity in reserve is influenced by the amount of gas bought by the country and set aside as reserve, this is influenced by the price of natural gas. As the price goes down, more gas is bought to set aside as reserve. Continuing on into the full model, the amount of gas that Europe imports positively influences the 𝑄𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒. Furthermore, as the demand for natural gas in a given time period goes down, this inversely influences 𝑄𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒 as less gas is consumed and more gas is set aside. \nIn short, the model above represents what happened in Europe during the winter of 2019 into 2020. As prices fell, 𝑄𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒 increased. As imports increased, 𝑄𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒 increased. Finally, as demand decreased since there was a milder winter, 𝑄𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒 increased. Following the discussion of this model, we will represent these changes graphically. \nFirst let us look at the demand for natural gas curve; reference Appendix A. E is historical equilibrium, and E’ is the new equilibrium given the conditions of a milder winter. As illustrated, the milder than normal winter shifts the 𝐷𝑛𝑔 curve to the left because demand decreases as people do not have to heat their homes as much. The equilibrium quantity moves leftward from Q to Q’. Because the country cannot just shut off the pipe, this difference Q’-Q becomes the reserves since it is not used. \nSecondly, let us consider the supply of natural gas; reference Appendix B. As discussed by the EIA, both Russia and the United States supplied a record amount of natural gas to Europe. Additionally, the pipeline was finished, which supplied Europe with even more natural gas. Both of these scenarios are reflected by a rightward shift of the supply curve, as the quantity of gas supplied to Europe unanimously increases. \nFinally, putting these two shifts in the supply curve together results in the chart demonstrated in Appendix C. As illustrated, the 𝑃𝑛𝑔 decreases, which means European countries can purchase and save more natural gas for a much lower price.\nTrends in Inequality\nGlobal Trends in Inequality\nEconomists have long been fascinated by the pursuit of discovering and quantifying the general laws of capitalism, and in the Twenty- First Century, their efforts have primarily turned towards applying those laws to identify the leading causes of economic inequality. Using decades of historical data and macroeconomic trends, economists analyze the long- run trends in the distribution of income and wealth, the rates of return on capital versus the growth rate of the economy, and the impact of changes in technology and taxation in order to provide a more comprehensive understanding of economic inequality. \nGiven the available data, background and upbringing, and place in history, economists often bring differing yet insightful contributions to the discussion of inequality, which culminate to better comprehension of the subject matter. This essay will review and analyze the work of leading economists in order to summarize the long-run trends in income and wealth inequality described in Roine and Waldenstrom (2015), discuss the leading causes of inequality according to Thomas Piketty (2015), and examine Acemoglu and Robinson’s (2015) critique of Piketty’s work, including the possible shortcomings of Piketty’s argument. \nPart One: Long Run Trends in the Distribution of Income and Wealth\nIn Long Run Trends in the Distribution of Income and Wealth, authors Jesper Roine and Daniel Waldenstrom outline the broad facts about long- run trends in the distribution of income and wealth using historical tax and estate data. Roine and Waldenstrom distinguish three possible broad eras that can usefully describe the overall developments of economic inequality across the 26 countries studied in their section on long- run trends. The first is the period before the First \nWorld War, the second is the period from around 1914 until 1980, and the third consists of the time thereafter. “In the first period evidence is relatively clear on the fact that inequality was historically high in the beginning of the twentieth century” (Roine and Waldenstrom). The general consensus points to the fact that there were relatively high and stable levels of inequality before the twentieth century, despite the lack of clear data. \nRoine and Waldenstrom next discuss the period from around 1914 to 1980, which was characterized by substantial drops in top income shares for almost all countries for which there is data. \"The top percentile share falls from around 20% before 1914 to between 5% and 10% around 1980 (Roine and Waldenstrom). However, the income share for the lower parts of the decile decrease much more modesty. Large parts of these decreases may be attributed to shocks such as the World Wars or the Great Depression, but it is worth noting that these drops occurred in countries that did not take part in war, such as Sweden.\nMost of the drop is related to decreasing capital income, which is income generated by an asset over time, rather than from work done using the asset. This explains why war, for example, decreases the top income shares much more dramatically than the income share for the lower parts of the decile; those at the top of the decile have much more capital income as their assets do work for them over time- such as in the stock market, compared to work done using the asset- which generates less income given the same amount of time. This is why, as we will see, that Thomas Piketty (2015) argues that war and depression are the only levelers of economic inequality. \nThe development after 1980 is less homogenous. In some countries, especially the United States and the United Kingdom, inequality has risen sharply. The developments over the first half of the twentieth century points to the importance of understanding the joint developments of wealth and income as much of the decrease is related to sharp drops in capital incomes in the top. \nThe cumulative impact of taxation over time also seems important, especially for understanding the lack of recovery of top income shares in the decades after the Second World War. In most countries much of the inequality increase is driven by changes within the top decile, suggesting that an explanation must include a mechanism that gives an increasing income advantage to the very top groups, rather than only accounting for differences between broad groups such as, for example, skilled and unskilled. \nThe Rise and Decline of General Laws of Capitalism\nIn 2014, Daron Acemoglu from MIT and James A. Robinson of Harvard University published a critique of Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty- First Century. Acemoglu and Robinson begin with a review of economists Ricardo and Marx, describing how they both attempted to condense the world around them into general laws of capitalism. Acemoglu and Robinson argue that the quest for general laws of capitalism is misguided because it ignores the key forces shaping how an economy functions: the endogenous evolution of technology and of the institutions and the political equilibrium that influence not only technology but also how markets function and how the gains from various different economic arrangements are distributed. They proceed to compare the shortcomings of Ricardo and Marx to those of Piketty, stating that Piketty also falls for the trap of condensing his findings into general laws. \nAcemoglu and Robinson point to various problems in Piketty’s interpretation of the economic relationships underpinning inequality, but the most important shortcoming is that, though he discusses the role of certain institutions and policies, he allows neither for a systematic role of institutions and political factors in the formation of inequality nor for the endogenous evolution of these institutional factors. This implies that his general laws have little explanatory power. They state that the relationship between the interest rate and the rate of economic growth, is not correlated with inequality- according to their regression analysis. Acemoglu and Robinson use data collected from South African and Sweden to demonstrate that using the top decile may miss the big picture about inequality, and that it is impossible to understand the dynamics of inequality in these societies without systematically bringing in institutions and politics and their endogenous evolution. In conclusion, these quests for general laws ignore both institutions and politics. \nPutting Distribution Back at the Center of Economics\nIn Putting Distribution Back at the Center of Economics: Reflections on Capital in the Twenty First Century (2015), Thomas Piketty provides remarks and clarifications regarding his discussion on economic inequality in his pivotal book Capital in the Twenty- First Century- responding to Acemoglu and Robinson’s critique published in 2014. In his reflection, Piketty discusses the relationship between the rental rate of capital (r) and the growth rate of the economy (g) and how it relates to income and wealth inequality. Piketty first clarifies that a common simplification of the main theme is that because the rate of return on capital r exceeds the growth rate of the economy g, the inequality of wealth is destined to increase indefinitely over time.\nPiketty argues that this facet only holds true given certain political shocks and institutional changes, which can be viewed as largely endogenous to the inequality and development process itself—played a major role in the past and will probably continue to do so in the future. Piketty instead argues that when there is a higher gap between r and g, then given certain political schemes or shocks, then inequality is likely to become larger; a higher gap between r and g allows an economy to sustain a level of wealth inequality that is higher and more persistent over time. \nPiketty also distinguishes between income and wealth inequality, stating that income inequality, in countries like the US, the rise in top income shares is due to the rising inequality of labor income, due to the rising inequality of skills and higher education and the exploding top marginal compensation. Piketty contrasts this with the inequality of wealth, which is the inequality of money saved. This often goes hand in hand with income inequality but differs because larger amounts of capital will generate more money by principle. If two people earn the same amount but one has more saved, the one with more saved will have more capital over time. \nConclusion\nThe long- run distribution can be categorized into three eras, all of which take on differing models of economic growth and changing amounts of inequality. With these models, economists can analyze and weigh the effects of these changes stated, such as war or changes in technology and taxation. Overall these discussions lead to a better understanding of inequality and can better guide policy makers to enact the correct steps to try and curb the rising levels of economic inequality in some countries such as the United States and United Kingdom. \nWorks Cited \nAcemoglu, Daron, and James A.

The bond sale was backed by several high-profile Western banks, including PNB Paribas, JP Morgan Chase, HSBC, Citi, and NCB Capital, suggesting that Western financial entities are willing to work with Saudi Arabia despite the furor over Mr. Khashoggi’s death in October of 2018.\nThe Saudi bond sale extends a borrowing spree that began in 2016 while faced with a fall in oil income. In 2016, the country sold $12.5 billion worth of bonds, culminating in the largest sovereign debt issued to date. This statistic shows the national debt of Saudi Arabia in relation to the gross domestic product (GDP) from 2012 to 2017, with projections up until 2022. In 2017, Saudi Arabia’s national debt amounted to approximately 17.21 percent of the gross domestic product in 2018.\nBreaking Down the Government Bonds\nA government bond is a debt security issued by a government to support government spending. Government bonds are considered risk-free and are traded in highly liquid markets. In occasional circumstances, governments can default on these bonds, which is often called a sovereign debt crisis. When investors and banks buy a country’s debt bond, the country promises the investor to pay back the bond amount with an agreed interest by a specified date; in a sovereign debt crisis, the country fails to pay back any or all of the promised amount. Additionally, government bonds yield a typically low rate of return. Only select bonds offer protection against inflation, which may outpace the bond’s interest rate. \nGovernment bonds assist in funding deficits in the federal budget and control the nation’s money supply. When the government repurchases its own bonds, the money supply increases as sellers receive funds to utilize in the market. Eventually, when funds are deposited into a bank, financial institutions utilize the money multiplier to expand the money supply. Alternatively, the government can also sell bonds that reduce the money supply as buyers are forgoing the ability to hold money now for future economic benefit. The government receives cash for its bonds and may proceed in retiring the cash to restrict the money supply if it chooses. The money supply is the entire stock of currency and other liquid instruments circulating in a country’s economy as of a particular time. The money supply can include cash, coins and balances held in checking and savings accounts. \nSaudi Debt Bonds\nBasis point (BPS) refers to a common unit of measure for interest rates and other percentages in finance. One basis point is equal to 1/100th of 1%, or 0.01%, or 0.0001, and is used to denote the percentage change in a financial instrument. One basis point above the Treasurys means that the interest on the bond is 0.0001 above the interest rate that the Treasury offers on their bonds. Increasing the basis points can make the bond more attractive to investors as a higher interest rate will yield a greater return. Five- year debt, 10- year bonds, and 30- year bonds describe the maturity of the bonds. For example, 100 basis points over the 10- year bonds means that the interest rate in the bond is 1% over the interest rate on the 10- year bonds that the US Treasury offers. \nThe kingdom raised $3 billion of long five-year debt at 110 basis points over Treasurys, $5 billion of long 10-year bonds at 145 basis points over Treasurys and $4.5 billion of 30-year bonds at 180 basis points over Treasurys, according to one of the lead arranging banks. In the 2 ½ years since 2016, Saudi Arabia has sold close to $60 billion in bonds, becoming one of the biggest issuers of debt in the emerging markets. \nA $4 billion 10-year bond was priced at 175 basis points over U.S. Treasury bond benchmarks and a $3.5 billion 31-year bond priced at 230 basis points. While those prices offer relatively generous yields for investors, they are similar to what Saudis have paid in the past on bonds and show that demand hasn’t withered for their debt since Mr. Khashoggi’s death. \nThe huge demand, larger than many market participants had expected, was partly due to ultra-low global interest rates and funds’ frustration with a lack of high-yielding assets around the world. The sale was also a success for the world’s top oil exporter in its efforts to convince investors that it can cope with an era of low crude prices and ultimately reduce its dependence on oil. London-based Capital Economics estimated the U.S. dollar issue would finance around a third of next year’s state budget deficit and almost all of the kingdom’s current account gap, meaning its foreign exchange reserves were unlikely to fall much further in coming years. \nSaudi Arabia recorded a government debt equivalent to 17.20 percent of the country’s Gross Domestic Product in 2017. Government Debt to GDP in Saudi Arabia averaged 36.38 percent from 1999 until 2017, reaching an all-time high of 103.50 percent in 1999 and a record low of 1.60 percent in 2014. These figures are in accordance with the Saudi’s rapid expansion and taking on more debt to fuel the growth. \n\n\n\n",
